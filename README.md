# Chess Engine + AI Project

> Author: Kaleb Ugalde

The goal of this project is to create a chess engine and an accompanying AI to go alone with it. I wanted to explore the minimax algorithm and the monte carlo tree search algorithm in this project as well. Inspiration for this project was seeing AlphaZero and having previous chess experience as a child.
